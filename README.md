## War or Peace

This War or Peace game awards wins in two ways. An outright win is when the losing players ends a turn with no cards in their deck. A win by default occurs when the losing player has less than three cards in their deck and therefore cannot play out a mutually assured destruction check. 

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 **War or Peace** project.
